Description: Spatio-temporal joint species distribution modeling via
    community-level basis functions.  CBFMs are built on the idea of
    fixed-rank kriging (FRK), where spatial and/or temporally indexed
    basis functions are included to account for spatio-temporal
    correlations within and between species.  The approach provides an
    alternative to the popular and powerful latent variable approach for
    joint species distribution modeling in community ecology, with the
    main advantage being that CBFMs can be computationally more efficient
    and scalable to fit.  This is because, by using a basis function
    approach, CBFMs can be set up as a type of generalized additive model
    (GAM), from which we can leverage from existing methods developed for
    GAMs.
