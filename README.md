# CBFM

`CBFM` is an R package for spatio-temporal joint species distributing modeling of multivariate abundance data, based on the use of community-level basis functions. As an alternative (but by no means necessarily superior) approach to the increasingly popular framework generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM), and as the name suggests, community-level basis function models (CBFMs) build on the idea of fixed-rank kriging (FRK), where spatial and/or temporally indexed basis functions are included to account for spatio-temporal correlations both within and between species. In doing, CBFMs bear a lot of similarity to and thus can be set up as a type of generalized additive model (GAM).


# Installation

Down the road, you can install the package on CRAN using:
```
install.packages("CBFM")
```
Currently, the developmental version of `CBFM` is available and can be installed from github with the help of `devtools` package using:
```
devtools::install_github("fhui28/CBFM")
```

# Getting started

<!-- For getting started with `CBFM` we recommend to read vignette [Analysing multivariate abundance data using gllvm](https://jenniniku.github.io/gllvm/articles/vignette1.html)
or introductions for using `gllvm` for [ordination](https://jenniniku.github.io/gllvm/articles/vignette3.html) and for [analysing species correlations](https://jenniniku.github.io/gllvm/articles/vignette4.html). -->
