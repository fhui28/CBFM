`CBFM` is an R package for spatial and spatio-temporal joint species distributing modeling of multivariate abundance data, based on the idea of using community-level (species-common) basis functions. It offers an alternative and connected (but by no means guaranteed to be superior) approach to the popular spatio-temporal generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM) method. 

As the name suggests, community-level basis function models (CBFMs) is built on the idea of fixed-rank kriging (FRK), where spatial and/or temporally indexed basis functions are included to account for spatio-temporal correlations both within and between species. In doing so, CBFMs bear a lot of similarity to and thus can be set up as a type of generalized additive model (GAM). This in turns allows CBFMs to be estimated in a relatively computationally efficient and scalable manner, by leveraging off the existing machinery for fitting and performing inference with GAMs


# Installation

<!--Down the road, you can install the package on CRAN using:
```
install.packages("CBFM")
```
-->
Currently, *a* version of `CBFM` is available and can be installed from github with the help of `devtools` package using:
```
devtools::install_github("fhui28/CBFM")
```

Alternatively, or if the above does not work, you may download a (supposedly) stable release of `CBFM` by choosing the latest release on the right hand side of this Github webpage, and install it manually on your machine.


# Getting started

We are in the process of producing a first manuscript introducing CBFMs to ecologists. For getting started with `CBFM` though, we recommend installing it and reading the help file for the main CBFM function. For broad introductions to joint species distribution modeling, especially using GLLVMs, we suggest 
[So Many Variables: Joint Modeling in Community Ecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.09.007), 
[How to make more out of community data? A conceptual framework and its implementation as models and software](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12757), 
[A comparison of joint species distribution models for presenceâ€“absence data](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13106) 
[Joint dynamic species distribution models: a tool for community ordination and spatio-temporal monitoring](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12464) and 
[Understanding co-occurrence by modelling species simultaneously with a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12180), along with the textbook
[Joint Species Distribution Modelling, with Applications in R](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108591720).

There are some existing and good \texttt{R} packages to fit joint species distribution models using GLLVMs, including: [Hmsc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmsc/index.html), 
[GLLVM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gllvm/index.html),  
[boral](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boral/index.html), and 
[VAST](https://rdrr.io/github/James-Thorson/VAST/).
Some but not all of them have capacity to handle spatio-temporal multivariate abundance data using spatio-temporal GLLVMs (or variations thereof).

For general introductions to spatial and/or temporal modeling using basis functions, please check out the excellent [FRK](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FRK/index.html) package for fixed rank kriging, which heavily inspired this package. Please also see the accompanying software article [FRK: An R Package for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Prediction with Large Datasets](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v098i04) and references therein. A more gentle but nevertheless fantastic introduction to basis functions for modeling correlations aimed at ecologists is provided  [The basis function approach for modeling autocorrelation in ecological data](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.1674). Of course, it would be remiss not to highlight the textbook [Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R](https://www.routledge.com/Generalized-Additive-Models-An-Introduction-with-R-Second-Edition/Wood/p/book/9781498728331), and the accompanying [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html), which this package both uses and takes much inspiration from. 


# If you find any bugs and issues...

If you find something that looks like a bug/issue, please let us know report it, so that we can resolve it and continue to improve this project (interest and time pending). To report a bug/issue, please make use of the Github issues and post it up there. As much as possible, please include in the issue:
1. A description of the bug/issue.
2. Paste-able code along with some comments that reproduces the problem. If you also have an idea of how to fix the problem (Francis tends to make a lot of mistakes in my code, so some may be easy amendments!), then even more awesome!
3. Required data files etc...

Thanks heaps!

Finally, please note Github issues is a place to post any bugs/issues/unusual behavior in relation to the package. **Please do not post any feature general statistical modeling questions**. They will very likely be ignored and/or deleted without prior consent. Much appreciated.
