Takes a fitted \code{CBFM} object calculates the residual between-species correlation matrix due to (all) the spatial and/temporal basis functions, along with corresponding uncertainty intervals if desired (via a simulation-based approach). Similar to \code{\link[=predict.CBFM]{predict.CBFM()}}, this correlation matrix can be calculated based on a different sets of basis functions to those used to actually fit the model. Additionally, the user can supplied two sets of spatial and/or temporal basis functions, in which case the function calculates cross-correlations (between and within species) between these two sets of basis functions.
}
\details{
This function is somewhat similar to \code{\link[boral:get.residual.cor]{boral::get.residual.cor()}} and \code{\link[gllvm:getResidualCor.gllvm]{gllvm::getResidualCor()}}, in calculating a residual between-species correlation matrix due to (all) the basis functions i.e., residual spatio-temporal correlations, along with corresponding uncertainty intervals if desired. Recall the general form of the mean regression model for the CBFM is given by

\deqn{g(\mu_{ij}) = \eta_{ij} = x_i^\top\beta_j + b_i^\top a_j,}

where \eqn{b_i} denotes a vector of spatial and/or temporal basis functions for unit \eqn{i}, and \eqn{a_j} denotes the corresponding regression coefficients for species \eqn{j}. So for example, users may choose to use the form \eqn{g(\mu_{ij}) = \eta_{ij} = x_i^\top\beta_j + b_{i,space}^\top a_{j,space} + b_{i,time}^\top a_{j,time},} where \eqn{b_i = (b_{i,space}, b_{i,time})} and \eqn{a_j = (a_{j,space}, a_{j,time})}; see also the help file for \code{\link[=CBFM]{CBFM()}} for more information.

One (although by no means the only, see the warning below) approach to thinking about the residual spatio-temporal covariance and hence correlation between two species \eqn{j} and \eqn{j'}, is based on examining the components \eqn{b_i^\top a_j} and \eqn{b_i^\top\beta_{j'}} across the observational units. A point estimate for this residual correlation can be constructed, along with a corresponding uncertainty interval by simulation if desired. For the latter, species-specific coefficients corresponding to the basis functions i.e., \eqn{\beta_j}, are sampled from their approximate large sample normal distribution (i.e., basically a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters; see \code{\link[=CBFM]{CBFM()}} and the section on estimation and inference), which are then used to calculate the correlations. This sampling and calculation is then performed a large number of times (as governed by \code{num_sims}) after which uncertainty intervals can be constructed by taking sample quantiles.

Note because this function calculates correlations as based on component of the linear predictor \eqn{b_i^\top a_j}, then it can not be applied to  \code{CBFM_hurdle} object (which by construction contains two linear predictors, so the user has to decide which component of the hurdle model they are interested in).

With the above definition of the residual between-species spatio-temporal correlation, note the basis functions on which the correlations are constructed need not be the same those used in fitting the original CBFM i.e., the \eqn{b_i}'s can be different to those of \code{object$B}. This is handled via the \code{new_B_space/new_B_time/new_B_spacetime} arguments. Additionally, it is possible to calculate residual within and between species \emph{cross-correlations} across two different sets of spatio-temporal basis functions. That is, residual correlations are calculated between \eqn{b_i^\top a_j} and \eqn{b_{i2}^\top a_{j'}}, where \eqn{b_i} and \eqn{b_{i2}} can be different sets of basis functions. This is handled by supplying both \code{new_B_space/new_B_time/new_B_spacetime} and \code{new_B_space2/new_B_time2/new_B_spacetime2} arguments simultaneously and as appropriate. Cross-correlations may be useful, say, if the two sets of basis functions reflect two different sets of sampling units, and we are interested in how spatially and/or temporally similar (or lack of) the species communities are across these two sets. Another example if is the same set of observational units are visited at two different time points, and we are interested in how similar (or lack thereof) the spatial correlations within and between species are between these two time points (see Thorson et al., 2016; Thorson, 2019; Ovakainen and Abrego, 2020, for similar ideas).

NOTE: A residual cross-correlation matrix is not going to be a standard residual correlation matrix in the sense of having the ones alone the diagonal. This is because even for the same species \eqn{j = j'}, the correlation is not guaranteed to be equal to one as the covariates being considered can be different.
}
\section{Warning}{
The approach this function takes to construct a residual spatio-temporal correlation matrix between species is \strong{by no means the only approach}. Indeed, with CBFMs the approach taken here to construct residual correlations can be seen as a basis-function analogue of equation 4 in Pollock et al., (2014), as well as Warton et al., (2015) and Hui (2016) among others, for calculating correlations due to measured predictors i.e., except we replace the measure predictors with basis functions.

An alternative approach, which is in line with how residual correlations are calculated in latent variable models (e.g., Warton et al., 2015; Niku et al., 2017; Ovaskainen et al., 2017, Niku et al., 2019), would be to calculate residual spatio-temporal correlations based directly off the community-level covariance matrices \code{Sigma_space/Sigma_time/Sigma_spacetime} and baseline between-species correlation matrices \code{G_space/G_time/G_spacetime} characterizing the random effects covariance of the species-specific coefficients \eqn{(a_1,\ldots,a_m)}. Such an approach is currently not available in CBFM...sorry!
